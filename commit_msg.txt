Fix Marketplace UI Overflows, Real Name Display, and Cleanup

- Updated Marketplace.tsx to use the synced user profile for real name display on listings.
- Improved the listing card layout with 'truncate', 'min-w-0', and 'shrink-0' to prevent buttons and names from overflowing.
- Added a one-time cleanup script in App.tsx to remove lingering mock listings (Kojo Asante, etc.) from the database.
- Passed the 'user' prop from App.tsx to Marketplace to ensure profile data consistency.
