Enhance Marketplace: Add Editing, Fix UI Overlaps, and Remove Mocks

- Implemented full Edit/Update functionality for marketplace listings.
- Improved 'handlePost' to handle both additions and modifications.
- Reduced action button sizes (Pencil, Trash, Message) in listing cards to prevent overlaps and improve layout.
- Removed all hardcoded 'MOCK_LISTINGS' from 'App.tsx' and 'Marketplace.tsx' to ensure a real data-only state.
- Refined price formatting logic to handle currency symbol stripping more robustly during edits.
