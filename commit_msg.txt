Fix Profile Persistence and Metadata Synchronization

- Added a 'profiles' table to the Dexie schema (v3) to persist user-defined metadata (name, photo, location, role) across cloud sync.
- Switched to useLiveQuery in App.tsx for real-time reactivity when the profile changes.
- Implemented handleUpdateUser to properly save the profile object to the database.
- Fixed the UI not updating after saving a profile image by ensuring the memoized 'user' object merges the stored profile correctly.
